# Budget Tracker
This Budget Tracker app allows user to track their budget online or offline. 

## Description 
Created a budget tracking app utilizing Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Heroku and Mongoose. Majority of the front end code was provided in a homework prompt as part of a web development boot camp. This app allows the user to track their budget and save them in a database.

## Installation 
You will need to npm init to get all the required node modules. If you are running the code locally the local host is set to port 3000. You will also need to go in to the config folder and possibly change the config.json values. The file used to start the project is server.js.

## Usage 
The primary purpose of this app is to practice with MongoDB and Mongoose but this app can be used to track  budget on the go.
